            I&apos;m a result-oriented frontend developer based in Hyderabad, India, with 3+ years of experience crafting smooth, engaging, and
            high-performance user interfaces.
            <br />
            <br />
            My journey began in the startup world, where I had the opportunity to build projects from the ground up. Starting with JavaScript and
            React, I worked on complex UI architectures, which helped me develop a deep understanding of frontend development. Over time, I expanded
            my skill set to include Next.js, TypeScript, Redux, and TailwindCSS, enabling me to build scalable, efficient, and visually appealing
            applications.
            <br />
            <br />
            I take pride in writing clean, maintainable code and following best practices to ensure performance, accessibility, and a great user
            experience.
            <br />
            <br />
            While frontend is my primary focus, I also have a working knowledge of Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, allowing me to handle backend logic
            when needed. I thrive on challenging projects that push me to optimize performance, refine UI/UX, and explore new technologies.

            Here&apos;s some tech and frameworks I love and work with:

                  <Skill icon={skill.icon} label={skill.label} variant="md" />
                </React.Fragment>
              ))}

            <span className="font-semibold text-zinc-900">Fun fact:&nbsp;</span>
            Rumor has it that if you mention &ldquo;clean code&rdquo; three times in front of a mirror, I might just appear and refactor your entire
            project. ðŸ˜†âœ¨
            <br />
            <br />
            Learning advanced Next.js is something I&apos;m working on, and I try to dedicate time to it whenever I can.
